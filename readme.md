BoilerStrap5
============

This is really just a combination of:

* HTML 5 Boiler Plate 4.0.0 - <http://html5boilerplate.com>
* Modernizr 2.6.1 - <http://modernizr.com>
* jQuery 1.8.8 - <http://jquery.com>
* Responsive Bootstrap 2.1.1 - <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>

The files were generated by <http://www.initializr.com/>, and I made a 
modification to load bootstrap using <http://www.bootstrapcdn.com> with
local fall-back, just like jQuery.
